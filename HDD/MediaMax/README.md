MediaMax Hard Drives
====================

This is a list of all tested MediaMax hard drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/bsdhw/SMART).

HDD by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days - avg. days per sample,
Err  - avg. errors per sample,
MTBF - avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|------|
| MediaMax  | WL1500GSA6472B     | 1.5 TB | 1       | 444   | 0     | 1.22   |
| MediaMax  | WL2000GSA6454      | 2 TB   | 3       | 697   | 6     | 0.89   |
