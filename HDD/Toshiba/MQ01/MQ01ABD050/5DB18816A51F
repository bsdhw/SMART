SMART Error Log Version: 1
ATA Error Count: 21734 (device log contains only the most recent five errors)
	CR = Command Register [HEX]
	FR = Features Register [HEX]
	SC = Sector Count Register [HEX]
	SN = Sector Number Register [HEX]
	CL = Cylinder Low Register [HEX]

Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as
DDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,
SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.

Error 21734 occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 4887 hours (203 days + 15 hours)
  When the command that caused the error occurred, the device was active or idle.
