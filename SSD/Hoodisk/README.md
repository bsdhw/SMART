Hoodisk Solid State Drives
==========================

This is a list of all tested Hoodisk solid state drive models and their MTBFs. See
more info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/bsdhw/SMART).

2. [ SSD by Family ](#ssd-by-family)

SSD by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days - avg. days per sample,
Err  - avg. errors per sample,
MTBF - avg. MTBF in years per sample.
