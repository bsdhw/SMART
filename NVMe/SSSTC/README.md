SSSTC NVMe Drives
=================

This is a list of all tested SSSTC NVMe drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/bsdhw/SMART).

NVME by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days - avg. days per sample,
Err  - avg. errors per sample,
MTBF - avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|------|
| SSSTC     | CL1-3D128-Q11 NVMe | 128 GB | 1       | 70    | 0     | 0.19   |
| SSSTC     | CL1-3D256-Q11 NVMe | 256 GB | 2       | 28    | 0     | 0.08   |
